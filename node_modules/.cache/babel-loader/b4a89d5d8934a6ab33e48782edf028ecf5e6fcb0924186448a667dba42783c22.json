Nakamoto's goal was to create\n                          digital money that would allow two strangers anywhere\n                          in the world to transact online without the need for a\n                          third-party intermediary such as a credit card company\n                          or a payment processor like Paypal. This necessitated\n                          a system that would remove a vexing problem known as\n                          \"double spending,\" in which a person may spend the\n                          same money multiple times. The solution is a network\n                          that constantly verifies Bitcoin's travel. The\n                          blockchain is that network.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          Every Bitcoin transaction is stored and verified by a\n                          global network of computers that is independent of any\n                          individual, business, or country. The blockchain is\n                          the database that stores all of this information.\n                          Bitcoins are mined through a massive, decentralized\n                          (also known as peer-to-peer) network of computers that\n                          is constantly verifying and securing the blockchain's\n                          accuracy. Miners are rewarded with small amounts of\n                          cryptocurrency in exchange for contributing their\n                          computing power to the blockchain. Every single\n                          bitcoin transaction is recorded on the ledger, with\n                          fresh information periodically accumulated in a\n                          \"block\" that is added to the previous blocks. The\n                          miners' combined computational power is used to ensure\n                          the ledger's accuracy as it grows. Bitcoin cannot\n                          exist without the blockchain; every new bitcoin, as\n                          well as every subsequent transaction involving all\n                          existing currencies, is recorded on it.\n                        </p>\n                      </div>\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n\n                  {/* 6 */}\n\n                  <div className=\"card\">\n                    <h6\n                      className=\"collapsed ltn__card-title\"\n                      data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\"\n                      data-bs-target=\"#faq-item-2-6\"\n                      aria-expanded=\"false\"\n                    >\n                      What does the future hold for blockchain technology?\n                    </h6>\n                    <div\n                      id=\"faq-item-2-6\"\n                      className=\"collapse\"\n                      data-bs-parent=\"#accordion_2\"\n                    >\n                      <div className=\"card-body\">\n                        <p>\n                          The blockchain concept has proven to be a foundation\n                          on which a wide range of applications can be built.\n                          Although blockchain is still a young and fast evolving\n                          technology, many experts have compared its potential\n                          to transform the way we live and work to that of\n                          public internet protocols like HTML in the early days\n                          of the World Wide Web. The global cryptocurrency\n                          market cap reached $3 trillion at the end of 2021, an\n                          all-time high. Blockchain technology underpins\n                          cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The\n                          adoption of blockchain, as well as the technology and\n                          products that it supports, will continue to have a\n                          significant impact on company operations. However,\n                          blockchain technology is much more than a mechanism\n                          for sending and receiving cryptocurrency in a safe\n                          manner. It can be utilized in a variety of\n                          applications outside of finance, including healthcare,\n                          real estate, insurance, voting, social benefits,\n                          gaming, green energy, and artist royalties.

Like in case\n                          of House or Building: a paper deed, Car: a paper\n                          title, Stock: a paper certificate, Bond : a paper\n                          treasury note and Cash: a paper dollar/euro/peso. A\n                          'token,' on the other hand, is a digital symbol of\n                          ownership. You own a token on Ethereum in the same way\n                          you own a property deed. The piece of paper isn't\n                          inherently valuable; it merely serves as a sign of\n                          possession.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          A token is a type of digital asset. The first digital\n                          token was Bitcoin. A token is a digital asset that can\n                          only be used online. Tokens, unlike most other files,\n                          photos, or data on computers or the internet, can't be\n                          copied. You can't maintain a copy of a token you send\n                          to someone. The blockchain, cryptocurrency, and\n                          crypto-asset worlds use the term 'token.' A 'token' is\n                          a representation of ownership. What that thing 'is' is\n                          extremely adaptable. Some tokens denote US dollars in\n                          crypto world like USDT or USDC, while others denote\n                          gold. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether are\n                          tokens in and of themselves.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          The practise of declaring ownership over anything as\n                          ownership in a digital token on Ethereum is known as\n                          tokenization. Companies like Circle has created\n                          tokenized dollars, Paxos has created tokenized gold,\n                          and now SmartCrowd has created tokenized real estate.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          Tokenization is the process by which a 'off-chain\n                          asset' is transformed into a 'on-chain asset.' Being\n                          incorporated in the Ethereum blockchain is referred to\n                          as being \"on-chain.\" This is a procedure that\n                          necessitates legal framework and compliance and is\n                          unique to each jurisdiction and asset class.\n                        </p>\n                      </div>\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n\n                  {/* 11 */}\n                  <div className=\"card\">\n                    <h6\n                      className=\"collapsed ltn__card-title\"\n                      data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\"\n                      data-bs-target=\"#faq-item-2-11\"\n                      aria-expanded=\"false\"\n                    >\n                      What are the advantages of tokenized real estate property?\n                    </h6>\n                    <div\n                      id=\"faq-item-2-11\"\n                      className=\"collapse\"\n                      data-bs-parent=\"#accordion_2\"\n                    >\n                      <div className=\"card-body\">\n                        <p>\n                          SmartCrowd is a company that sells real estate through\n                          the internet, allowing people to buy property from\n                          almost anywhere in the globe. Because SmartCrowd\n                          properties can be fractionalized, which means that,\n                          interested investors can invest whatever amount that\n                          meets their demands. SmartCrowd has also decreased the\n                          time it takes to buy real estate from a minimum of\n                          30-40 days (with multiple stages involving third\n                          parties) to only 10 minutes and on your phone or\n                          computer.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          Real estate investments can now be made inexpensive to\n                          almost anybody thanks to tokenization. A single\n                          SmartCrowd property token costs between $50 and $150,\n                          which are the lowest investment minimums available in\n                          the real estate business. Traditional pen-and-paper\n                          competitors to SmartCrowd have investment minimums\n                          ranging from $5,000 to $10,000.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          Real estate is also known for its illiquidity. Because\n                          of the fractionalization of the tokens and the\n                          potential reach of internet-based markets, real estate\n                          may be accessed by a far larger number of potential\n                          buyers by converting it into digital tokens.
