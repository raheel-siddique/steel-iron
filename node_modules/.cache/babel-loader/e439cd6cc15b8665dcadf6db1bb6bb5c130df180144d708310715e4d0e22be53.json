In this sense, a blockchain\n                          serves as the foundation for immutable ledgers, or\n                          transaction records that can't be changed, erased, or\n                          destroyed. Blockchains are also known as distributed\n                          ledger technology because of this (DLT). The\n                          blockchain concept was first presented as a research\n                          project in 1991, and it before its first popular use\n                          in use, Bitcoin, in 2009. The creation of numerous\n                          cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi)\n                          applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart\n                          contracts has skyrocketed the use of blockchains in\n                          the years thereafter.\n                        </p>\n                        <ul>\n                          <li>\n                            Step 1): A transaction is requested by someone.\n                            Cryptocurrency, contracts, records, or other\n                            information could be involved in the transaction.\n                          </li>\n                          <li style={{listStyleType: 'none'}}>\n                            <ul>\n                              <li>\n                                Step 2) With the help of nodes, the requested\n                                transaction is broadcasted to a P2P network.\n                              </li>\n                              <li>\n                                Step 3) Using well-known techniques, the network\n                                of nodes confirms/validate the transaction and the\n                                user's status.\n                              </li>\n\n                              <li>\n                                Step 4) The new block is then added to the\n                                existing blockchain after the transaction is\n                                complete.

This\n                          makes it possible to conduct financial transactions\n                          using blockchain technology.

Blockchain 2.0 Smart Contracts:\n                          Smart Contracts, which are little computer programs\n                          that \"live\" in the blockchain, are the next essential\n                          principles.

Since then, every cryptocurrency\n                          (Bitcoin or Altcoin) has evolved from the ideas\n                          outlined in that paper. Nakamoto's goal was to create\n                          digital money that would allow two strangers anywhere\n                          in the world to transact online without the need for a\n                          third-party intermediary such as a credit card company\n                          or a payment processor like Paypal. This necessitated\n                          a system that would remove a vexing problem known as\n                          \"double spending,\" in which a person may spend the\n                          same money multiple times. The solution is a network\n                          that constantly verifies Bitcoin's travel. The\n                          blockchain is that network.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          Every Bitcoin transaction is stored and verified by a\n                          global network of computers that is independent of any\n                          individual, business, or country. The blockchain is\n                          the database that stores all of this information.\n                          Bitcoins are mined through a massive, decentralized\n                          (also known as peer-to-peer) network of computers that\n                          is constantly verifying and securing the blockchain's\n                          accuracy. Miners are rewarded with small amounts of\n                          cryptocurrency in exchange for contributing their\n                          computing power to the blockchain. Every single\n                          bitcoin transaction is recorded on the ledger, with\n                          fresh information periodically accumulated in a\n                          \"block\" that is added to the previous blocks. The\n                          miners' combined computational power is used to ensure\n                          the ledger's accuracy as it grows. Bitcoin cannot\n                          exist without the blockchain; every new bitcoin, as\n                          well as every subsequent transaction involving all\n                          existing currencies, is recorded on it.\n                        </p>\n                      </div>\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n\n                  {/* 6 */}\n\n                  <div className=\"card\">\n                    <h6\n                      className=\"collapsed ltn__card-title\"\n                      data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\"\n                      data-bs-target=\"#faq-item-2-6\"\n                      aria-expanded=\"false\"\n                    >\n                      What does the future hold for blockchain technology?\n                    </h6>\n                    <div\n                      id=\"faq-item-2-6\"\n                      className=\"collapse\"\n                      data-bs-parent=\"#accordion_2\"\n                    >\n                      <div className=\"card-body\">\n                        <p>\n                          The blockchain concept has proven to be a foundation\n                          on which a wide range of applications can be built.\n                          Although blockchain is still a young and fast evolving\n                          technology, many experts have compared its potential\n                          to transform the way we live and work to that of\n                          public internet protocols like HTML in the early days\n                          of the World Wide Web.

Blockchain technology underpins\n                          cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The\n                          adoption of blockchain, as well as the technology and\n                          products that it supports, will continue to have a\n                          significant impact on company operations. However,\n                          blockchain technology is much more than a mechanism\n                          for sending and receiving cryptocurrency in a safe\n                          manner.

This piece of paper serves as a\n                          representation of the asset's ownership. Like in case\n                          of House or Building: a paper deed, Car: a paper\n                          title, Stock: a paper certificate, Bond : a paper\n                          treasury note and Cash: a paper dollar/euro/peso.

The first digital\n                          token was Bitcoin. A token is a digital asset that can\n                          only be used online. Tokens, unlike most other files,\n                          photos, or data on computers or the internet, can't be\n                          copied. You can't maintain a copy of a token you send\n                          to someone. The blockchain, cryptocurrency, and\n                          crypto-asset worlds use the term 'token.' A 'token' is\n                          a representation of ownership. What that thing 'is' is\n                          extremely adaptable. Some tokens denote US dollars in\n                          crypto world like USDT or USDC, while others denote\n                          gold. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether are\n                          tokens in and of themselves.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          The practise of declaring ownership over anything as\n                          ownership in a digital token on Ethereum is known as\n                          tokenization. Companies like Circle has created\n                          tokenized dollars, Paxos has created tokenized gold,\n                          and now SmartCrowd has created tokenized real estate.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          Tokenization is the process by which a 'off-chain\n                          asset' is transformed into a 'on-chain asset.'
