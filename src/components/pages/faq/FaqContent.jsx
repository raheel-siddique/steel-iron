                          A blockchain is a decentralized database that is
                          shared among computer network nodes. A blockchain acts
                          as a database, storing information in a digital
                          format. Blockchains are well known for their critical
                          role in keeping a secure and decentralized record of
                          transactions in cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin
                          and Ethereum. The blockchain's novelty is that it
                          ensures the fidelity and security of a data record
                          while also generating trust without the requirement
                          for a trusted third party.

                            Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs
                            from traditional databases in the way it is stored:
                            data is stored in blocks, which are then connected
                            together via cryptography.

                          <li>
                            <li>
                              As new information is received, it is entered into
                              a new block. Once the block has been filled with
                              data, it is chained onto the previous block,
                              forming a chronological chain of data.

                              A blockchain can hold a variety of data, but the
                              most prevalent application so far has been as a
                              transaction ledger.

                              In the case of Bitcoin, blockchain is employed in
                              a decentralized manner, meaning that no single
                              person or group has powerâ€”rather, all users have
                              control collectively
                            </li>

                            <li>
                              Decentralized blockchains are immutable, meaning
                              that the data inputted cannot be changed. This
                              means that transactions in Bitcoin are forever
                              recorded and accessible to everybody.

                          The purpose of blockchain is to enable for the
                          recording and distribution of digital data without the
                          ability to modify it. In this sense, a blockchain
                          serves as the foundation for immutable ledgers, or
                          transaction records that can't be changed, erased, or
                          destroyed. Blockchains are also known as distributed
                          ledger technology because of this (DLT). The
                          blockchain concept was first presented as a research
                          project in 1991, and it before its first popular use
                          in use, Bitcoin, in 2009. The creation of numerous
                          cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi)
                          applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart
                          contracts has skyrocketed the use of blockchains in
                          the years thereafter.

                          makes it possible to conduct financial transactions
                          using blockchain technology. It's a money and a
                          payment system. The most well-known example in this
                          category is Bitcoin. Blockchain 2.0 Smart Contracts:
                          Smart Contracts, which are little computer programs
                          that "live" in the blockchain, are the next essential
                          principles. They are open-source computer programs
                          that run in the background and check for criteria such
                          as facilitation, verification, and enforcement. It's a
                          contract that's utilised to replace regular contracts.

                          In late 2008, Nakamoto published a whitepaper
                          detailing the principles behind Bitcoin, a new type of
                          digital currency. Since then, every cryptocurrency
                          (Bitcoin or Altcoin) has evolved from the ideas
                          outlined in that paper. Nakamoto's goal was to create
                          digital money that would allow two strangers anywhere
                          in the world to transact online without the need for a
                          third-party intermediary such as a credit card company
                          or a payment processor like Paypal. This necessitated
                          a system that would remove a vexing problem known as
                          "double spending," in which a person may spend the
                          same money multiple times. The solution is a network
                          that constantly verifies Bitcoin's travel. The
                          blockchain is that network.

                        <p>
                          Every Bitcoin transaction is stored and verified by a
                          global network of computers that is independent of any
                          individual, business, or country. The blockchain is
                          the database that stores all of this information.
                          Bitcoins are mined through a massive, decentralized
                          (also known as peer-to-peer) network of computers that
                          is constantly verifying and securing the blockchain's
                          accuracy. Miners are rewarded with small amounts of
                          cryptocurrency in exchange for contributing their
                          computing power to the blockchain. Every single
                          bitcoin transaction is recorded on the ledger, with
                          fresh information periodically accumulated in a
                          "block" that is added to the previous blocks. The
                          miners' combined computational power is used to ensure
                          the ledger's accuracy as it grows. Bitcoin cannot
                          exist without the blockchain; every new bitcoin, as
                          well as every subsequent transaction involving all
                          existing currencies, is recorded on it.

                          The blockchain concept has proven to be a foundation
                          on which a wide range of applications can be built.
                          Although blockchain is still a young and fast evolving
                          technology, many experts have compared its potential
                          to transform the way we live and work to that of
                          public internet protocols like HTML in the early days
                          of the World Wide Web. The global cryptocurrency
                          market cap reached $3 trillion at the end of 2021, an
                          all-time high. Blockchain technology underpins
                          cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The
                          adoption of blockchain, as well as the technology and
                          products that it supports, will continue to have a
                          significant impact on company operations. However,
                          blockchain technology is much more than a mechanism
                          for sending and receiving cryptocurrency in a safe
                          manner. It can be utilized in a variety of
                          applications outside of finance, including healthcare,
                          real estate, insurance, voting, social benefits,
                          gaming, green energy, and artist royalties. The global
                          economy is prepared for the blockchain revolution,
                          with technology already having an impact on business
                          and society on many levels.

                          ownership. You own a token on Ethereum in the same way
                          you own a property deed. The piece of paper isn't
                          inherently valuable; it merely serves as a sign of
                          possession.

                          A token is a type of digital asset. The first digital
                          token was Bitcoin. A token is a digital asset that can
                          only be used online. Tokens, unlike most other files,
                          photos, or data on computers or the internet, can't be
                          copied. You can't maintain a copy of a token you send
                          to someone. The blockchain, cryptocurrency, and
                          crypto-asset worlds use the term 'token.' A 'token' is
                          a representation of ownership. What that thing 'is' is
                          extremely adaptable. Some tokens denote US dollars in
                          crypto world like USDT or USDC, while others denote
                          gold. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether are
                          tokens in and of themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The practise of declaring ownership over anything as
                          ownership in a digital token on Ethereum is known as
                          tokenization. Companies like Circle has created
                          tokenized dollars, Paxos has created tokenized gold,
                          and now SmartCrowd has created tokenized real estate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Tokenization is the process by which a 'off-chain
                          asset' is transformed into a 'on-chain asset.' Being
                          incorporated in the Ethereum blockchain is referred to
                          as being "on-chain." This is a procedure that
                          necessitates legal framework and compliance and is
                          unique to each jurisdiction and asset class.

                          SmartCrowd is a company that sells real estate through
                          the internet, allowing people to buy property from
                          almost anywhere in the globe. Because SmartCrowd
                          properties can be fractionalized, which means that,
                          interested investors can invest whatever amount that
                          meets their demands. SmartCrowd has also decreased the
                          time it takes to buy real estate from a minimum of
                          30-40 days (with multiple stages involving third
                          parties) to only 10 minutes and on your phone or
                          computer.

                          Real estate investments can now be made inexpensive to
                          almost anybody thanks to tokenization. A single
                          SmartCrowd property token costs between $50 and $150,
                          which are the lowest investment minimums available in
                          the real estate business. Traditional pen-and-paper
                          competitors to SmartCrowd have investment minimums
                          ranging from $5,000 to $10,000.

                        <p>
                          Real estate is also known for its illiquidity. Because
                          of the fractionalization of the tokens and the
                          potential reach of internet-based markets, real estate
                          may be accessed by a far larger number of potential
                          buyers by converting it into digital tokens. The more
                          market players that digital tokens can reach, the more
                          liquid real estate becomes. Furthermore, Ethereum (and
                          xDai) financial apps provide ways for obtaining
                          liquidity for valued tokenized assets.

                          Property Management is outsourced by SmartCrowd to
                          local professionals. Of course, we continue to closely
                          monitor and care for each of the Token Holders'

                          SmartCrowd's property management businesses are in
                          charge of renting out the property, collecting rental
                          income, and maintaining or repairing it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The rental income received to SmartCrowdToken holders
                          is reduced by costs linked with property management
                          and maintenance.

                        <p>
                          For two reasons, we elected to outsource property
                          management: It frees up resources so that SmartCrowd
                          may focus on what it does best â€”- Property management
                          is a time-consuming endeavor. As we expand, we plan to
                          provide properties around the United States and other
                          nations.

                        <p>
                          We do, however, keep a close eye on all elements of
                          the properties, from rent and rental prices to
                          physical conditions, restorations, code compliance,
                          and even landscaping upgrades where appropriate.

                          Our management, SmartCrowd (SmartCrowdToken Inc.), is
                          not a limited liability company (LLC) that owns the

                          member ownership reasons, each LLC would continue to
                          operate as a separate legal organization. Whatever
                          happens to SmartCrowdToken Inc., an LLC's assets and
                          SmartCrowdTokens will remain separate and unaffected.

                          The SmartCrowdTokens would continue to represent and
                          evidence ownership of the LLC's property and, as such,
                          could be traded in the market as needed, as long as
                          applicable securities transfer requirements are
                          followed.

                        <p>
                          As a result, you retain ownership of your tokens! If
                          SmartCrowd Inc. is liquidated (which is not the
                          intention, to be clear!), a new Managing Member will
                          be selected. This could be a temporary lawyer, an
                          accountant, or even the most powerful Holder, for
                          example.

                          The method of purchasing tokenized real estate is
                          simple! There are, however, a few steps that must be
                          completed beforehand.

                          The first step is to create a user account and upload
                          a photo of your ID, a selfie, and your desired

                          sign (within approximately 1 to 2h). These legal
                          documents link the token to the property's ownership
                          and provide more information about the legal entity
                          that owns it.

                          A â€˜walletâ€™ is a core component of a
                          blockchain/cryptocurrency system. SmartCrowd accounts
                          for fractional ownership of properties on its platform
                          using the Ethereum blockchain and the Gnosis Chain.
                          Our assets are housed in 'Ethereum wallets' compatible
                          with the Gnosis Chain because we run on Ethereum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          A 'wallet' might alternatively be referred to as a
                          'public key' or a 'public address.'
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          A wallet is made up of two components: a "public
                          address" and a "private key." A mailbox and a mailbox
                          key are good metaphors for this. Anyone can put
                          something in the mailbox, but only the owner of the
                          private key has access to it. The connection between a
                          'public' and a 'private' key is founded in
                          public-private key cryptography, which is what gives
                          cryptocurrency its name.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          To get your acquired fractional shares of real estate,
                          you'll need an Ethereum wallet that's compatible with
                          the Gnosis Chain so that the assets can be sent to
                          you. There are a variety of wallets to choose from,
                          and each one handles your private key differently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Make certain you understand how each solution handles
                          your private keys.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          It's critical to have a private key! Any owner of the
                          private key has access to any of the funds held in the
                          wallet with which it is associated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          More information regarding Ethereum wallets can be
                          found on the Ethereum.org website and on the Gnosis
                          Chain website.

                          SmartCrowd Wallet (mobile), Trust Wallet (mobile),
                          AlphaWallet (mobile), and MetaMask are among the
                          wallets we recommend (mobile and browser).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          It's simple to make a wallet. You only need to
                          download and install the app of your choosing before
                          creating an account. When you create an account, the
                          app will provide you with a "recovery phrase" that you
                          must remember in order to keep access to your wallet.
                          You are not required to provide any personal
                          information, such as your email address or name.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          You'll be able to find your public Ethereum/Gnosis
                          Chain address (which always starts with "0x") once
                          your account is created. This is the address to which
                          your SmartCrowdTokens and rentals will be sent.

                          Ethereum not only allows you to hold digital assets,
                          but it also allows you to conduct financial
                          transactions using the platform's built-in
                          applications. Ethereum applications allow users to
                          utilize their digital assets. On Ethereum, digital
                          assets can be used for trading, exchange, borrowing,
                          lending, derivatives, and prediction markets, among
                          other things
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Financial applications built on Ethereum can provide
                          basic financial services to people who don't have
                          access to them in their own country. Many Ethereum
                          applications provide users with savings accounts or
                          investment options. Unlike traditional financial
                          services such as banks, where you give up ownership of
                          your assets and trust that the bank will keep them
                          safe, Ethereum applications allow you to keep full
                          control of your digital assets while using them in
                          financial applications.

                        <p>
                          This also applies to scalability layers such as Gnosis
                          Chain.

                          Levinswap is a Gnosis Chain application that provides
                          liquidity for the tokens you buy. Levinswap allows you
                          to sell your assets immediately at market value. The
                          price of Levinswap tokens changes depending on supply
                          and demand, as well as overall market liquidity in
                          Levinswap. Uniswap is similar to Uniswap, however it
                          runs on Ethereum.

                          announcements at any price you like, and smart
                          contracts ensure that the transaction between you and
                          the buyer goes smoothly. If a buyer is interested, he
                          can use the smart contract to purchase your tokens.

                          'Sell Tokens' option on the homepage. The SmartCrowd
                          website takes 8-14 days to complete sales. The tokens
                          are sold for the property's fair market value, as
                          established by the most recent appraisal. Once a year,
                          all properties are appraised again.
