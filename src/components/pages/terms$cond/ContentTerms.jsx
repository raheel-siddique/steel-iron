                        Your use of Interactive Areas is at your own risk.
                        Enforcement of the user content or conduct rules set
                        forth in these Site Terms is solely at Company’s
                        discretion, and failure to enforce such rules in some
                        instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to
                        enforce such rules in other instances. In addition,
                        these rules do not create any private right of action on
                        the part of any third party or any reasonable
                        expectation that the Sites will not contain any content
                        that is prohibited by such rules. As a provider of
                        interactive services, Company is not liable for any
                        statements, representations or User Content provided by
                        its users in any public forum, personal home page or
                        other Interactive Area. Although Company has no
                        obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content
                        posted in any Interactive Area, Company reserves the
                        right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen or
                        edit any User Content posted or stored on the Sites at
                        any time and for any reason without notice, and you are
                        solely responsible for creating backup copies of and
                        replacing any User Content you post or store on the
                        Sites at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the
                        Interactive Areas or other portions of the Sites in
                        violation of the foregoing violates these Site Terms and

                        suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas
                        and/or the Sites.

                        I. This User Agreement shall be construed in accord with
                        the applicable laws of United States of America
                        regardless of your physical location.

                        exclusive jurisdiction in any proceedings arising out of
                        this agreement.

                        and us in the most expedient and cost effective manner,
                        you and we agree that any and all disputes arising in
                        connection with the Terms shall be resolved by binding
                        arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit
                        in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead
                        of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery
                        than in court, and can be subject to very limited review
                        by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and
                        relief that a court can award. Our agreement to
                        arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all
                        claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the
                        Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
                        misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and
                        regardless of whether the claims arise during or after
                        the termination of the Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE
                        THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE EACH
                        WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE

                        acknowledgement that you are able to electronically
                        receive, download, and print this Agreement.

                        provide these records to you electronically instead of
                        in paper form.

                        right, in our sole discretion, to communicate with you
                        via the Postal Service and other third-party mail
                        services using the address under which your account is

                        electronically will remain in effect until you withdraw
                        it. You may withdraw your consent to receive further
                        records and notices electronically at any time by
                        contacting Customer Support. If you withdraw your
                        consent to receive such records and notices
                        electronically, we will terminate your access to the
                        Services, and you will no longer be able to use the
                        Services. Any withdrawal of your consent to receive

                        only after we have a reasonable period of time to
                        process your request for withdrawal. Please note that
                        your withdrawal of consent to receive records and
                        notices electronically will not apply to records and
                        notices electronically provided by us to you before the
                        withdrawal of your consent becomes effective.
