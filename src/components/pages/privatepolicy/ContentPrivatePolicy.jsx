                    <p>

                      the right under the CCPA to direct us not to make your
                      Personal Information available for valuable consideration
                      at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not make
                      available the Personal Information of consumers we
                      actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we
                      receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”)
                      from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of
                      age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13
                      years of age. Consumers who opt-in may opt-out at any
                      time.

                    <p>
                      9.3.2. To exercise the right to opt-out or right to
                      opt-in, you (or your authorized representative) may submit
                      a request to us by sending us an e-mail at
                      ________________________________. Once you make an opt-out
                      request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before
                      asking you to reauthorize certain information sharing
                      practices. However, you may change your mind and opt back
                      in at any time by sending us an email

                      9.4.1. To exercise the access, data portability, and
                      deletion rights described above, please submit a
                      verifiable consumer request to us by:

                    <p>
                      9.4.2. Sending us an e-mail

                    <p>
                      9.4.3. Only you, or a person registered with the
                      California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on
                      your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request
                      related to your Personal Information. You may also make a
                      verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.

                    <p>
                      9.4.4. You may only make such a request for access or data
                      portability twice within a twelve (12) month period. The
                      verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient
                      information that allows us to reasonably verify you are
                      the person about whom we collected Personal Information or
                      an authorized representative, and describe your request
                      with sufficient detail that allows us to properly
                      understand, evaluate, and respond to it
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      9.4.5. We cannot respond to your request or provide you
                      with Personal Information if we cannot verify your
                      identity or authority to make the request and confirm the
                      Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable
                      consumer request does not require you to create an account
                      with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in
                      a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s
                      identity or authority to make the request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      9.4.6. We will respond to verifiable requests received
                      from California residents as required by law. Any
                      disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12)
                      month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s
                      receipt. The response we provide will also explain the
                      reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
                      For data portability requests, we will select a format to
                      provide your Personal Information that is readily usable
                      and should allow you to transmit the information from one
                      entity to another entity without hindrance.

                    <p>
                      9.4.7. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to
                      your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive,
                      repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that
                      the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made
                      that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before
                      completing your request.

                      overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the

                      with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to
                      which the controller is subject.

                      the European legislator to obtain from the controller
                      restriction of processing where one of the following
                      applies:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      9.7.5.1.1. The accuracy of the personal data is contested
                      by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller
                      to verify the accuracy of the personal data. The
                      processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the
                      erasure of the personal data and requests instead of the
                      restriction of their use instead. The controller no longer
                      needs the personal data for the purposes of the
                      processing, but they are required by the data subject for
                      the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
                      The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to
                      Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether
                      the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of
                      the data subject. If one of the aforementioned conditions
                      is met, and a data subject wishes to request the
                      restriction of the processing of personal data stored by
                      us, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the
                      controller. Our Employees will arrange the restriction of

                      (including Google) to previous visitors to our Website. It

                      the contact form to make an enquiry or complete a

                      11.2 Each Google Analytics and Google AdWords advertiser
                      has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be tracked
                      using the Website of an AdWords advertiser. The
                      information obtained using the conversion cookie is used
                      to create conversion statistics for the AdWords
                      advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking.
                      Customers are told the total number of users who clicked
                      on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking
                      tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain any
                      information that can be used to personally identify users.
                      If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can
                      opt-out of this by easily disabling the Google Conversion
                      Tracking cookie by changing your browser settings. In
                      doing so, you will not be included in the conversion
                      tracking statistics. Conversion cookies are stored based
                      on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The Website operator has a
                      legitimate interest in analysing user behaviour to

                      15.2 We are committed to providing you with meaningful
                      choices about the information collected on our Website for
                      third party purposes, and that is why we provide the

                      browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is
                      currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT
                      means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common
                      approach to responding to DNT.
